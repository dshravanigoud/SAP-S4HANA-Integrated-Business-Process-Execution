# SAP-S4HANA-Integrated-Business-Process-Execution
End-to-end SAP S/4HANA 1709 execution covering Order-to-Cash, Procure-to-Pay, Production Planning, MRP, Warehouse Management, and FI integration. Includes real system document flow (SO → PR → PO → Production → STO → Delivery → Billing → Accounting) demonstrating full supply chain integration.

What I Executed in the System

I executed a full end-to-end integrated business process in SAP S/4HANA 1709 covering:
	•	Sales & Distribution (SD)
	•	Materials Management (MM)
	•	Production Planning (PP)
	•	Material Requirements Planning (MRP)
	•	Warehouse Management (WM)
	•	Financial Accounting (FI)


Scenario Executed

A customer placed an order for:
	•	5 Deluxe Touring Bikes (Finished Goods)
	•	50 Off-Road Helmets (Trading Goods)

There was insufficient inventory available.

This triggered an integrated procure-to-produce-to-deliver workflow.

	•	Created Sales Quotation
	•	Converted to Sales Order
	•	Executed ATP availability check
	•	Triggered procurement & production due to stock shortage

2. Procurement (MM)
	•	Created Purchase Requisitions
	•	Converted to Purchase Orders
	•	Posted Goods Receipts
	•	Posted Vendor Invoices
	•	Reviewed automatic FI postings

3. MRP & Production (PP)
	•	Ran MRP (single-level and multi-level)
	•	Converted planned orders to production orders
	•	Issued raw materials
	•	Received semi-finished and finished goods

4. Inter-Plant Logistics
	•	Created Stock Transport Order (Dallas → Distribution plant)
	•	Posted Goods Issue at production plant
	•	Posted Goods Receipt at distribution plant

5. Warehouse Execution (WM)
	•	Executed transfer orders for put-away
	•	Performed picking during outbound delivery

6. Fulfillment & Financial Close
	•	Created outbound delivery
	•	Generated billing document
	•	Validated revenue, COGS, inventory, and AP/AR postings

	•	End-to-end ERP process integration
	•	Automatic FI postings from logistics transactions
